# Meilisearch Manager

A Nuxt-based web UI for managing Meilisearch instances.

This project is the refactored Nuxt version of the original Vue SPA project: [connorabbas/meilisearch-manager](https://github.com/connorabbas/meilisearch-manager).

## Features

- :rocket: **Multi-instance** mode for local development and testing
- :lock: **Single-instance** mode with server-side credential proxying
- :bar_chart: **Dashboard** with stats and version details
- :open_file_folder: **Indexes** listing, creation, inspection, primary key updates, and deletion
- :gear: **Index settings** full JSON viewer/editor
- :page_facing_up: **Documents** import, search (full-text, hybrid, geo), sort, filter, pagination, edit, and delete flows
- :key: **API keys** create, view, edit, copy, and delete flows
- :ballot_box_with_check: **Tasks** history with filtering, infinite scroll, and optional polling
- :hourglass: **Data backups** with dump and snapshot exports
- :pushpin: **Search Rules** to pin selected documents at fixed positions in search results 
- :test_tube: **Experimental features** toggling
- :iphone: **Responsive** layout
- :waning_crescent_moon: **Dark mode** support

## Getting Started

### Demo

Check out the live demo (hosted with GitHub pages): [https://connorabbas.github.io/meilisearch-manager-next/](https://connorabbas.github.io/meilisearch-manager-next/)

## Configuration

The app supports two distinct operational modes, each designed for a different use case.

### Multi-Instance Mode

Designed for **local development, testing, and exploration**.

In this mode, the app behaves as a pure client-side SPA. You can add, manage, and switch between multiple Meilisearch instances directly from the browser UI. Instance credentials (host and API key) are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

**Characteristics:**

- Manage multiple Meilisearch instances from one dashboard
- Credentials stored in browser `localStorage` (never sent to any backend server)
- The Meilisearch JavaScript client runs directly in the browser
- Your Meilisearch instance must expose appropriate CORS headers
- Can be deployed statically (GitHub Pages, S3, CDN, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> Credentials in `localStorage` are isolated to the browser and the app's origin. They are not transmitted to any server. This is generally safe for development and testing, but may not meet organizational security requirements for production use.

### Single-Instance Mode

In this mode, the app runs behind a Nitro server. The admin API key lives only in server-side environment variables. All Meilisearch requests are transparently proxied through the app's backend, which injects the real credentials server-side.

```env
NUXT_MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://your-instance-domain.com
NUXT_MEILISEARCH_API_KEY=yourAdminApiKey
```

**Characteristics:**

- Admin API key is **server-side only** - never exposed to the client
- All requests proxied through `/api/meilisearch/*` with credentials injected by Nitro
- Instance management UI is disabled (single pre-configured instance only)
- Eliminates CORS concerns (browser talks to same-origin proxy)
- **Requires a running Nitro server (Node environment)** - cannot be used with static hosting

**Typical deployment:** Host the app alongside your Meilisearch instance (same network/VPC, or behind the same reverse proxy) so the Nitro server can reach Meilisearch securely.

> [!CAUTION]
> **By default, the single-instance proxy route has no built-in authentication.** The `/api/meilisearch/*` catch-all proxy injects the admin API key server-side, but the route itself accepts any request that reaches it.
>
> **You MUST deploy this behind an authentication layer in production environments** (e.g., Traefik Basic Auth, VPN, Cloudflare Access), enable the optional built-in auth (see below), or restrict it to a private network. Exposing the app directly to the internet without authentication is equivalent to giving public admin access to your Meilisearch instance.

#### Optional Built-in Authentication

For a minimal, self-contained setup, you can enable built-in authentication using `nuxt-auth-utils`:

```env
NUXT_AUTH_ENABLED=true
NUXT_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD=a-random-password-with-at-least-32-characters
```

- Only applies in **single-instance mode**.
- When enabled, all `/api/meilisearch/*` proxy requests and page visits require an authenticated session.
- Users are redirected to a login page; sessions are stored in encrypted cookies.
- If you prefer an external auth layer (e.g., Traefik Basic Auth), leave `NUXT_AUTH_ENABLED` unset or set it to `false`.

### Explicit Mode Control

You can explicitly force a mode with `NUXT_SECURE_MODE`:

```env
NUXT_SECURE_MODE=true   # Force secure mode (throws on startup if credentials missing)
NUXT_SECURE_MODE=false  # Force multi-instance mode (even if credentials are set)
```

If omitted (default is `'auto'`), the app auto-detects: secure mode activates when both `NUXT_MEILISEARCH_HOST` and `NUXT_MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` are present.

### Static Deployments

For static hosting (GitHub Pages, S3, CDN), set:

```env
NUXT_PUBLIC_STATIC_DEPLOY=true
```

This skips the server configuration check entirely and boots directly into multi-instance mode. This is automatically set in the GitHub Pages workflow.

## Docker Images

Pre-built images are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cabbas23/meilisearch-manager) for both operational modes.

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for image tags, Docker Compose examples, Traefik Basic Auth setup, and production security guidance.
